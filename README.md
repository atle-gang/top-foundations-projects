# JavaScript Relearning Projects

Welcome to my JavaScript Relearning Projects repository! This space is dedicated to small and manageable projects aimed at helping me reacquaint myself with JavaScript after a hiatus of almost 5 months. The projects here are designed to be simple yet effective in reinforcing my understanding of JavaScript concepts.

## Projects Overview

1. **Landing Page:**
   - Create a basic landing page with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - Focus on incorporating interactive elements using JavaScript to enhance user experience.

2. **Etch-a-Sketch:**
   - Build a digital Etch-a-Sketch drawing application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - Practice handling user input and manipulating the DOM dynamically.

3. **Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock Game:**
   - Implement the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game with a twist - including lizard and Spock.
   - Utilize JavaScript for game logic, user input, and displaying results.

## Why This Repository?

This repository serves as a personal playground for honing my JavaScript skills. The chosen projects are intentionally modest to facilitate a gradual reacquaintance with the language. Feel free to explore the code, and if you have suggestions or improvements, I'd love to hear them!

## Project Structure

Each project is organized into its own directory for clarity. Inside each project directory, you'll find the necessary files and folders.
